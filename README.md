# Computer Architecture hands-on exercises based on the Nios V soft processors
Hands-on exercises for the Computer Architecture course at the [University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain)](https://internacional.ulpgc.es/en/) using Nios V-based software SoCs and DE0-Nano board

[Lab 1. RISC-V instruction set architecture and programming of NiosV/m processor](labs/lab1/lab1tutorial.pdf)

Lab 2. Performance evaluation of the memory hierarchy of a computer and reverse engineering of the data cache memory

Lab 3. Performance evaluation of pipelined processors

Lab 4. Nios V multiprocessor implementation, parallel programming, and performance evaluation

Lab 5. Nios V processor with customized architecture for a software application

Folder organization: <br />
./code: assembler and C programs <br />
./labs: pdf documents for hands-on exercises <br />
./SoC_configurations: binary files to configure the FPGA of a Terasic DE0-Nano board <br />
