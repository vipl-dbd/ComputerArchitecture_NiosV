## Topics

Labs are based on principles presented in 30 one-hour lectures during the semester in parallel with the lab sessions. The main topics covered are: methodology for performance evaluation of RISC computers, microarchitecture of pipelined processors and its efficient programming, performance evaluation of cache memories, design and performance evaluation of main memory, static scheduling of instructions, out-of-order instruction execution, microarchitecture and evaluation of superscalar processors, VLIW architectures and microarchitectures, high-performance parallel computing using shared memory multi-core architectures, GPUs, multicomputers and application specific instruction set processors.

## Skills gained by students in this Computer Architecture course

Practical experience on Computer Architecture using real FPGA-based hardware, assembly language programming using a RISC-based instruction set and several bare-metal computer systems, multi-thread programming, code optimization using information from the computer architecture, performance evaluation of processors and multiprocessors, performance evaluation of memory hierarchy including main memory and caches, programming, performance evaluation and customization of the microarchitecture of a general-purpose processor integrated into a System-on-Chip (SoC) or subsystem (SS).

## Professional opportunities that demand these skills across industries

Performance Architect (workload analysis, understand bottlenecks in cores and SoCs), CPU Core Microarchitecture/RTL Engineer (RTL design for sections of the processor pipeline, define the high-level architecture), Platform Hardware and Systems Engineer (development of hardware and systems), System and Solution Architect ((micro)architecture simulation, workloads characterization, C++/Python/Perl programming), GPU Platform Hardware Design Engineer (RTL coding, and simulation for graphics IPs), Platform Solutions Architect (translate requirements and key performance indicators into platform architecture encompassing hardware, software, SoCs, and other components designed to support a variety of systems, solutions, and applications), Platform Validation Engineer (develop verification plans for coherency/ memory/ power management/ security/ domains of pre-silicon SoC/SS), Security Research Engineer (design and implementation of scientific research projects for secure computing, cryptographic algorithms, communication, memory and networking), Silicon Architecture Engineer (logic & circuit design, physical design, validation and debug).

## Nios II

Another [repository](https://github.com/vipl-dbd/ComputerArchitecture_NiosII) includes similar hands-on exercises using the Nios II soft processor that have been used in the training of more than 1,000 computer science undergraduate students for more than 10 years.
